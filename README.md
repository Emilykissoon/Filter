This program was designed to apply four different filters to .bmp files.

These four filters are:
1. Grayscale - converts the .bmp file to black and white
2. Reflection - creates a mirror image of the .bmp file
3. Blur - blurs the .bmp file slightly
4. Edges - highlights all the edges in the .bmp file, that it, where any two different colours meet.

This C project incoporated 2D arrays, classes, objects, conversion to and from hexadecimal, the use of command line arguments, the use of header files and several various types of loops.
